## Q1: What is the need for DevOps? ⭐

**Answer:**

Nowadays instead of releasing big sets of features, companies are trying to see if small features can be transported to their customers through a series of release trains. This has many advantages like quick feedback from customers, better quality of software etc. which in turn leads to high customer satisfaction. To achieve this, companies are required to:

1.  Increase deployment frequency
2.  Lower failure rate of new releases
3.  Shortened lead time between fixes
4.  Faster mean time to recovery in the event of new release crashing

DevOps fulfills all these requirements and helps in achieving seamless software delivery.

## Q17: What is the role of a configuration management tool in DevOps? ⭐⭐

**Answer:**

*Configuration Management* tools' purpose is to automatize deployment and configuration of software on big number of servers. Most CM tools usually use agent architecture which means that every machine being manged needs to have agent installed.
